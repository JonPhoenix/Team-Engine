# Team Creator App

  ## Description
  This command line application will build a software engineering team by prompting the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The manager can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

  When the manager has completed his team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a team roster with the information previously provided. Using the **Team Creator App** a manager will have a quick access to the name, role, email and GitHub profile / School of each team member.

  The **Team Creator App** has been created with **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **ES6+**, using the standard library package **fs (file system)**, installing the [**Inquirer** package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and the [**Jest** package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) as dependencies.

  This command-line application will run in Terminal (Mac), Git Bash (Windows), and VSCode (Mac & Windows). The final deployed **team.html** file will look similar to this preview:
